# Team Awesome

Team Awesome is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that can be used by organizations and their employees for tracking time when working on projects.

## Features
- ⏱ Track time when working on projects
- 🚁 See an overview of all your team members and which client they're working for
- 🎛 Sort your time entries by client or based on date
- 👫 Line-up your team members based on first name

## Prerequisites
Using the [latest stable Node version (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/) & the [latest release of NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm-versions) is recommended. Check your Node version with ``node -v`` in your terminal.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone [this/repo]
```

2. Install the dependencies needed to run the app.
```
npm i
```

3. Run a local build
```
npm build
```

## Run tests
This app uses Jest, React testing library and Cypress for unit testing, snapshots and end-to-end testing. To run these you can use ``npm test``.

## Run Storybook
For documenting, testing and creating reusable components this app uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). To run it you first need to have a local build of Team Awesome running on your machine. Then you can use:
```
npm run storybook
```
This will start Storybook locally and output the address. Depending on your system configuration, it will automatically open the address in a new browser tab, and you'll be greeted by a welcome screen.

## Build upon
- **React & NextJS** to make the app interactive ⚡️
- **Typescript** to speed the development process and spot bugs sooner 🪲
- **Styled components** to make it pretty ✨
- **Vercel** to deploy the app 🚀
- **Storybook** for documenting, testing and creating reusable components 📚
